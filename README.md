# Data Science using Python

A hands on approach to learning Data Science with Python. This repo contains several project I have done to learn making predictions on datasets using ML.

## Projects 
###  Kidney Disease?
Check for whether a patient has kidney disease or not, based on several parameters?
### Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits 
Recognition of handwritten digits done using SVC approach. 
### Parkinson's disease prediction
This is done using PCA (Principal component analysis approach)
### Classify the mushroom
Using the decision tree classifier, the type of mushroom was found based on the features of the data set 
### DLA HAR (Human Activity Recognition)
Use random forest classifier to predict the activity of a human. 

### And a lot more...
Crime activity prediction, wheat growth, clipped audio clip prediction
